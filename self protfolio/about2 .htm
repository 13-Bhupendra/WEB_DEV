                Hi, I’m Bhupendra . I’m currently learning web development and pursuing <br>
                a diploma in Computer Science. I have a strong interest in technology and <br>
                am focused on expanding my skills in web development. My goal is to combine my <br>
                knowledge of programming with practical experience to create effective digital solutions.
                <br><br><br><br>

                <u>
                    <h2 style="color: aqua; position: static;">Skills</h2>
                </u> <br>
                I am skilled in Web Development .<br>
                I also have basic knowledge of Photoshop and Illustration, which helps me in creating <br>
                visual designs. In the field of web development, I use tools like Visual Studio Code, <br>
                Git, and GitHub for coding and version control. Additionally, I use platforms like Vercel <br>
                and Netlify for previewing and deploying websites. My strengths also include problem-solving, <br>
                time management, and effective communication, which are essential for successful project <br>
                execution. <br><br><br><br>

                <u>
                    <h2 style="color: aqua; position: static;">Hobbies</h2>
                </u> <br>
                I have a deep passion for art, sketching, and drawing, which allow me to express my creativity. <br>
                I also enjoy painting, as it helps me relax and explore new ideas. Apart from art, I love staying <br>
                active by playing cricket, which teaches me teamwork and strategy. Another hobby of mine is chess,<br>
                where I sharpen my critical thinking and problem-solving skills. These hobbies not only provide me <br>
                with a creative outlet but also help me stay focused and disciplined in other areas of life.
